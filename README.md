## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

Hey! I’m Travanti, a college student who’s really into robotics, coding, and tech in general. I’m learning more every week and building new projects to push myself. Right now, I’m comfortable with **C#**, but I’ve also been putting in work learning **Python** and getting better at solving problems with it.

I like coding projects that make me think — especially games, simulations, or anything that helps me sharpen my skills while having fun. I’m also big on learning by doing, not just watching tutorials.

## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

- 🎮 [2048 Game](https://github.com/Travantiv2/2048) – Python version of the classic tile puzzle. Built it to practice logic and game loops.
- 🔢 [Guess the Code](https://github.com/Travantiv2/Guess-the-Code) – A number guessing game with clue logic and input validation. 
- 💸 [T’s ATM](https://github.com/Travantiv2/T-sATM) – Simple ATM system with PIN login, balance checking, deposits, and withdrawals.

More coming soon — I’m working on doing at least one cool Python project every week to keep improving.

## 🔧 Right Now I’m Focused On:

- Getting stronger with **Python** through weekly challenges
- Stepping up my **C#** and learning how to use it outside of unity
- Exploring file handling, GUIs, and real-world problem-solving
- Becoming the kind of developer who actually finishes their ideas 💀

## 🎮 Some Fun Stuff

- I’ve been into games since forever — it’s what got me curious about how things work under the hood
- I like projects that are both creative and logical
- I’m working toward a career in robotics, and I want to help build things that make life better
